When building a [Dedicated Games Server](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/dedicated-server.html), content of a scene may differs between the client and server versions. For example, the cameras, rendering, and UI components may not be required on the server side, and server-related managers should not be included client side.

To optimize your builds, you can select what [game objects](#game-object-selection), [components](#component-selection), and prefab assets are present in different build targets: **Standalone** or **Dedicated Server**. You can select each part of a scene to be stripped individually, by [search criteria](#selection-by-search), or [automatically](#automatic-selection) from the build target.
